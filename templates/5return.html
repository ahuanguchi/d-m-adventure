    <h2>Computer Lab</h2>
    <p>You return to the computer lab. Clara enters the room and informs you that after <u>Katie, the Deity of Democracy</u>, instigated a <a target="_blank" href="/rps.html">coup</a> in Matt's one-party state, she managed to defeat Matt by throwing a wildly dancing Kenny at him while <u>Kevin, the Deity of Freaky Magic</u>, distracted him with a card trick. You win! Yay!</p>
