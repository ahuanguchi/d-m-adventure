    <h1>KeyboardSynth</h1>
    <p>Press keys on the rows that begin with Z and Q to play notes (both begin on the pitch C). Accidentals are on the rows immediately above. Press + and - to change octaves. Hold \ to toggle octaves mid-note. Move your mouse to control the volume (right is louder). Use the arrow keys and shift to pick a waveform (p5.sound's implementation of pulse wave oscillators is buggy, so shift may not work as expected). Press 1 to toggle recording.</p>
